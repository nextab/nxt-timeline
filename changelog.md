# 2024-08-31 - Added functionality to add a custom .svg as a timeline stop
- You no longer have to choose between a circle, a rectangle or no item for a timeline stop, you can now upload your own custom svg file
- Option to set the width of the uploaded .svg file to properly customize the look of the timeline
- Moved all inline JS for the WordPress admin options page to a dedicated file (/js/nxt-timeline-admin.js) to clean up the code (a little)
- Improved UI as options that are not in use (e.g. color of timeline stop when a custom .svg is in use) will now appear greyed out / disabled
